# Command Notes (My Toddler notes)

These notes explain the commands I use across labs in simple terms.

## Index
- [Users and Groups](users-and-groups.md)
- [Sudo and Sudoers](./sudo-and-permissions.md)
- [Files and Directories](./files-and-directories.md)

> Tip: In each lab README, I include a short command summary and then link back here for detailed explanations.
