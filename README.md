# System Administration & Networking Labs

This repository contains hands-on System Administration and Networking labs completed (Personal Learning) along with Software Development Course Year 2 (Cloud Computing)

Each lab focuses on practical skills, clear documentation, and evidence-based learning.

Alongside the technical labs, I’m improving my documentation skills by writing Markdown in Visual Studio Code. This is an area I didn’t fully explore in Year 1, where the emphasis was on HTML, CSS, and web application development.

## Lab Structure
Each lab includes:
- Objective and scope
- Environment details
- Step-by-step tasks
- Screenshots as evidence
