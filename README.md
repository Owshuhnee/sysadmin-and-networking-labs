# System Administration & Networking Labs

This repository contains hands-on **System Administration and Networking labs** completed as part of my **personal learning**, alongside **Year 2 of my Software Development course (Cloud Computing)**.

Each lab focuses on practical skills, clear documentation, and evidence-based learning through real configuration, testing, and troubleshooting.

Alongside the technical work, I’m also improving my documentation skills by writing **Markdown in Visual Studio Code**. This is an area I didn’t fully explore in Year 1, where the focus was primarily on **HTML, CSS, and web application development**.
