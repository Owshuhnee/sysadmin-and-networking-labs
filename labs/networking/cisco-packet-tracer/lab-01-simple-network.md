# Cisco Packet Tracer - Lab 01 - Simple Network

## Objective

The goal of this lab was to become familiar with the Cisco Packet Tracer interface and understand:

- Logical vs Physical workspace
- Device placement and wiring
- Cable selection and connections
- DHCP configuration
- Basic connectivity verification

Since this was my first time using Packet Tracer, the primary focus was tool familiarity rather than advanced configuration.

## Tasks Performed

### 1️⃣ Navigated Logical & Physical Modes
- Switched between Logical and Physical views
- Explored device placement inside racks and wiring closets
- Practiced zooming, panning, and workspace navigation

---

### 2️⃣ Connected Devices
- Connected PC to Wireless Router using Ethernet
- Connected Wireless Router to Cable Modem
- Connected Cable Modem to Internet Cloud using coaxial cable
- Used both manual cable selection and automatic connection tool

---

### 3️⃣ Configured End Devices
- Enabled DHCP on PC
- Verified IP address, subnet mask, gateway, and DNS assignment
- Modified laptop physical module (removed wired NIC, inserted wireless NIC)
- Connected laptop to wireless network
- Verified connectivity using `ping`

---

## Challenges Encountered

- Adjusting to the Packet Tracer UI
- Cable icons do not display labels on hover, making identification confusing
- Initially unsure which cable type to use
- Required understanding the difference between Ethernet and coaxial connections
- Learned how device modules affect available interfaces

Using the automatic connection tool helped confirm correct cabling while learning the interface.

---

## Key Concepts Reinforced

- Difference between Logical and Physical views
- Device-to-device cable selection
- DHCP configuration basics
- DNS vs connectivity troubleshooting
- Hardware modularity in networking devices

---

## Reflection

This lab helped me become more comfortable with the Packet Tracer interface.  

Initially, navigating the UI and selecting the correct cable types was confusing due to unlabeled icons. However, through troubleshooting and experimentation, I gained a better understanding of:

- How devices are interconnected
- How DHCP assigns IP configurations
- How physical modules impact available ports
- How to verify network connectivity

Although this was a beginner lab, it strengthened my foundational networking skills and improved my confidence in using Packet Tracer.
